denoising images
Gray scale stretch is contrast stretch, which is actually a gray scale transformation, using the simplest piecewise linear transformation function. Its main idea is to improve the dynamic range of gray scale during image processing.Gray stretch and gray linear transformation is similar, both use gray linear transformation, but the difference is that gray stretch is not a complete linear transformation, but a piecewise linear transformation.Gray scale stretching can control the distribution of the output gray scale histogram more flexibly. It can selectively stretch a certain gray scale interval to improve the output image.

For mean filtering, the noise content in the image is very small, which indicates that mean filtering has a good inhibitory effect on gaussian noise with zero mean.Mean filter has no obvious effect on removing salt and pepper noise.This is because the mean value of salt and pepper noise is not zero, and the mean value filtering only equalizes the noise intensity at a certain point to the surrounding data, so the result is that the noise amplitude decreases, but the particle area of the noise point increases at the same time.After mean filtering, the noise of the image information polluted by noise can be suppressed to some extent. However, due to the algorithm design of mean filtering, the image edges become fuzzy.

For median filter, there is a lot of noise in the image, which affects the basic information of the image.This is because gaussian noise pollutes all points with amplitude of random size, so how does it work
Data selection, always get the contaminated value.Median filter to remove salt and pepper noise can have very good effect, because the salt and pepper noise only randomly appear on the part of the image point, so according to the principle of median filter, through data sorting method, the image is not in the noise pollution points instead of the noise of the value of the probability is bigger, so the noise suppression effect is very good, at the same time basic keep the sharpness of the picture.Compared with the mean filter, the median filter has a slightly more complex algorithm, but it can maintain the sharpness of the picture much better than the mean filter.
